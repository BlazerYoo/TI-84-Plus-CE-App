# TI-84-Plus-CE-App

The original TI-84 Plus CE App is available here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ti-84-plus-ce-app-for-chr/compdaiogbfdpildfbleipdcglmmlojo.

When you go to that link on a non-Chrome OS device, you cannot install the app.

Here, you can install the app on non-Chrome OS devices.

Just download the "TI_84_Plus_CE_App.zip" and unzip it.

Then go to chrome://extensions/ and enable "Developer mode" on the top right.

Then click on "Load unpacked" on the top left and navigate to and select your unzipped folder.

Done. You can now access the app at chrome://apps/.
